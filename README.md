# Emerging-Markets-Macro-Research

Project Overview

This project analyzes the relationship between inflation rates and bond yields across three major emerging markets — India, Brazil, and South Africa — from 2019 to 2024.
The goal was to understand how macroeconomic indicators like inflation influence sovereign bond pricing, credit risk, and monetary policy effectiveness.

Key Work Done

Data Collection: 
Created a synthetic but realistic dataset simulating inflation and bond yields across 6 years.

Data Analysis:
Merged and cleaned inflation and bond yield data.
Calculated correlation coefficients to measure the relationship between inflation and bond yields for each country.

Data Visualization:
Plotted inflation and bond yield trends using Seaborn line charts.
Highlighted macroeconomic trends and anomalies across countries.

Insight Generation:
Identified how inflation volatility relates to sovereign yield shifts.
Compared macroeconomic stability across India, Brazil, and South Africa.
